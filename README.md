# GSQ Vocabularies
## Introduction
The Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ) publishes vocabularies - a way to describe things and the relationship between things.

A vocabulary is a set of agreed terms:
* In GSQ, a vocabulary defines the terms used to describe and represent things in the domain of science and data management.
* Vocabularies align information within a business area or across systems.
* Vocabularies can be very complex (with thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts only).

Read [Why Vocabularies?](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/vocabularies/wiki/Why-Vocabularies%3F) and more subjects in the [Vocabularies Wiki](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/vocabularies/wiki).

## Vocabulary - how it all hangs together

**Fig. 1: Vocabulary context diagram**

1. We use tools such as Vocbench or Excel to create the vocabulary using [SKOS Simple Knowledge Organization System](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference). See also the [SKOS Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer) for the basics.
2. The native format for a vocabulary is a TTL (turtle) file. This file contains [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) triples - subject > predicate > object statements.
3. We use Github (where you are now) to store and manage versions of vocabulary TTL files. Github also provides workflow functionality to approve vocabularies. Read the [Github getting started guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
4. We import the TTL files into GraphDB to create a triple store. GraphDB lets us query the triples.
5. VocPrez presents our vocabs on the web for people and computers to read. VocPrez pulls the triples from GraphDB to create a cache of the vocabularies.
6. CKAN drop-down form fields pull their values from VocPrez. This ensures that the attributes uses to describe a dataset comes from the controlled vocabulary. 


## How to create a vocabulary

**Fig. 2: Vocabulary build and pull process**

1. **Search for existing** International, National, and Industry Standards. Use directly where possible, augment and adapt when needed, create new original vocabulary as a final option (see below for links to existing vocabularies).
2. **Create the vocabulary** using the [SKOS Simple Knowledge Organization System](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/)
    - See also the [SKOS Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) for the basics
    - Use one of these tools:
        1. [Vocbench](www.vocbench.gsq.digital:7200/) to create the vocabulary.  
        2. Excel templates - [GSQ's Excel SKOS Vocabulary Builder](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/vocabularies/blob/master/templates/SKOS_Vocabulary_Builder.xlsm).  
        3. Text Editor, e.g. Visual Studio Code
            - for VS Code, use the extension [Language Support for RDF related language syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fantasticfears.semantic-data-model-language) for formatting support.  
3. **Allocate a URI** to the vocab
    - we use `linked.data.gov.au` for all GSQ vocabs
    - Arrange for URI allocation via the [Contacts](#contacts) below
3. **Export the vocabulary** to a TTL file
    - If using Vocbench, it is easier to export the TTL from the Build repository in GraphDB. Follow the [instructions here](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/standard/exporting-data.html).
4. **Validate the TTL file**
    1. Use the [online Skosify tool](http://demo.seco.tkk.fi/skosify/skosify). 
        - This tests for SKOS conformance
        - Tick the checkbox *Keep skos:related relationships within the same hierarchy*, leave the other checkboxes unticked.
        and/or,
        Use the [online SKOS testing tool](http://labs.sparna.fr/skos-testing-tool/). 
        - This tests for SKOS conformance, missing language tags, valid label rules, and notation uniqueness
    2. The use the GSQ Vocab [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) Shapes files
        - This tests for GSQ requirements over and beyond SKOS, such as particular metadata for the vocab
        - The files are stored in this repo, [shapes](shapes/)
        - Use the [pySHACL](https://github.com/RDFLib/pySHACL) tool on your desktop to do the validation
5. **Import the TTL file** into a development branch in Github. Name your branch *dev-vocabularyName*. See [how-to instructions here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). 
6. **Submit a pull request** to the vocabularies repository.
  - Create a branch for your vocab named `review-vocabularyName`
  - add your vocab to that branch
  - create a Pull Request from that `review-` branch to `master` branch and nominate reviewers
    - See [how-to instructions here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews)
  - Once 2+ reviews have passed (usually a data managmenet staff member and a science domain expert), the final reviewer will merge the `review-` branch into `master` branch and delete the `review-` branch
7. **Publication of the vocab** to production VocPrez will be automated from here onwards
  - You should see the vocab in https://vocabs.gsq.digital/vocabulary/ within hours of approval and merger
  - If testing of the vocab in VocPrez is required, the test instance will be used: https://test.vocabs.gsq.digital/vocabulary/
  - During UAT the vocabularies rendered in the test systems will be derived from files presented in https://vocabs.uat.gsq.digital/vocabulary
